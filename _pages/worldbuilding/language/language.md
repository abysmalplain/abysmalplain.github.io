# language

It's been a long time goal of mine to type up all my notes from university and collect them all in one place, and that's basically what I'm doing here, so no guarantees that it's all useful information for a first-time conlanger. The first section is written specifically with worldbuilding in mind, and putting together a phonetic inventory from an overview of phonetics isn't difficult, but I get the feeling generative syntax may turn some people off. In that case, these notes are more for my own reference.

## the biological basis of language

Where did language come from? Well, first we can look at the <a href="/worldbuilding/language/biology/vocalization/">anatomy that produces sound</a>, and the <a href="/worldbuilding/language/biology/communication/">myriad different methods of communication</a> found across the animal kingdom.

Then we can take a look at the <a href="/worldbuilding/language/biology/brain/">language centres in the brain</a>, and finally we can <a href="/worldbuilding/language/biology/evolution/">make some guesses</a> about the hows and whys of language's origin.

## speech production

A <a href="/worldbuilding/language/">closer look at the human vocal tract, and an introduction to phonetics</a>, featuring my good friend J.C. Catford. Bonus: acoustics and overtones!

## the basics

An <a href="">introduction to the field of linguistics</a>: its history, its key players, its frameworks and theories, its big debates.

Lower level university courses usually follow a progression from phonology to morphology to syntax, and I'll be doing the same because it keeps things clean, but real language doesn't have such neat distinctions; all areas overlap and interact. So before we get too in-depth, <a href="/worldbuilding/language/">here's my overview</a> of what these subjects are and the relationships between the three, so you can get a feel for how non-linear the following sections really are.

Phonology.

Morphology.

Syntax.

## other stuff

Semantics. Child language acquisition. Writing systems. PIE.
