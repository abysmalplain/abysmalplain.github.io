   <h1>worldbuilding</h1>
   <p>Up front I will say that most of the information here is with an eye towards terrestrial worldbuilding. I do plan to add sections on, say, the atmospheric conditions of gas giants, but earthlike planets are where most of my interest and therefore most of my knowledge lie so for now, that's what's here.</p>

   <p>I've listed everything in the order I prefer to work, but I've tried to aim for enough redundancy that you don't have to do them in any kind of order.</p>

   <p>First things first, here's my <a href="/worldbuilding/appendices/basics/">basic science refresher</a>. These are the key principles of chemistry and physics that I found useful to have a firm grasp on before tackling anything else.</p>
</section>

<section>
   <h2>astronomy</h2>
   <p>If you're going very large scale with your worldbuilding I would recommend the <a href="/worldbuilding/astronomy/universe">history and structure of the universe</a>. This covers the various types of nucleosynthesis (how atoms are formed), the fundamental process of gravitational collapse (by which basically everything else is formed), and what kinds of substances are floating around out there for us to build from.</p>

   <p>If your needs are a little less grandiose, here's my guide to <a href="/worldbuilding/astronomy/planetary-systems/">planetary systems</a>, covering the kinds of stars that support planets, the variety of planetary configurations that are out there, orbital mechanics, the definition of a planet, and all sorts of smaller bodies that exist in a system.</p>

   <p>Additionally, here's my enormous <a href="/worldbuilding/astronomy/objects/">list of astronomical objects</a> with accompanying stats and notes on how to implement them. Everything you could ever want to populate a night sky with.</p>

   <p>And finally, <a href="/worldbuilding/build/">build your own planetary system</a>: choose your star, find your limits, space your orbits, create atmospheres, it's all here. I've included notes on habitability of earthlike planets if that's what you're looking to build.</p>

<section>
   <h2>terrestrial planets</h2>
   <p>Head over to <a href="/worldbuilding/planetology/geosphere/">geography and geology</a> for things like the internal structure of rocky planets, the internal processes leading to tectonic activity, the formation of a rocky surface, the role of water in facilitating plate tectonics, topography and weathering; glaciation; all that good stuff. Here's my spectacular <a href="/worldbuilding/planetology/geosphere/sidebar/">sidebar on geology and global distribution of soil types as they relate to plant life</a>. I made this last separate as it is entirely overkill; I just really like rocks and dirt.</p>

   <p>Master weather patterns in the <a href="/worldbuilding/planetology/atmosphere/">atmosphere</a> section, and ocean currents and fluvial processes in the <a href="/worldbuilding/planetology/hydrosphere/">hydrosphere</a> section.</p>

   <p>Put it all together and map out your <a href="/worldbuilding/planetology/climate/">climate zones</a>.</p>
</section>

<section>
   <p>Section on other types of planets hopefully coming soon.</p>
</section>

<section>
   <h2>biology</h2>
   <p>First off, a discussion on the <a href="/worldbuilding/biology/life">definition of life</a> and the possible origins of life on Earth. Following from there, some potential prerequisites. Also discussed is the definition of intelligent life, and some more potential prerequisites.</p>

   <p>Other stuff: biochemistry and the smallest building blocks of life, metabolism, reproduction and genetics, evolution: what it is and what it isn't, design principles.</p>

   <p>Some more stuff on life, such as the evolution of eyes, colour vision, sex systems. Plants vs animals vs fungi vs bacteria vs archaea. Viruses. Nutrition.</p>
</section>

<section>
   <h2>language</h2>

   <p>Anatomy of the human vocal tract. Language and the brain.</p>

   <p>The evolution of language. Vocalization in different animals: humans, other primates, whales, other cetaceans, other mammals, frogs, birds.</p>
</section>

<section>
   <h2>culture</h2>
   <p>I won't be doing guides for culture building per se, for a couple of reasons: one being that there is no formula you can compute to build a society, and the other being that I don't want to give away all my best ideas. However, I do have some notes on science-y things that a society might engage in. Astrometry. Music.</p>
